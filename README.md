# ConsensusLLM: A Consensus Large Language Model Ensemble for Truth-Seeking

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked incredible potential in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, these models at times generate outputs that are inacccurate and can, in the worst cases, be dangerous. The nature of the high apparent quality of the output can easily cause a reader who is unfamiliar with the topic to miss the fact that the hallucination is completely untrue, fabricated by an incredibly elloquent author. To address this challenge, we propose an open-source project that combines the power of ensemble learning and reinforcement learning to create a truth-seeking AI system. The goal is to develop a system that leverages multiple LLMs, each constructed and/or trained differently, to generate more reliable and accurate responses.

## The Consensus LLM Ensemble

Our project aims to create a Consensus LLM Ensemble, an architecture that utilizes multiple LLMs working together in concert to generate responses to a given prompt. The system comprises individual LLMs with diverse perspectives and approaches, along with a separate "Consensus LLM" that reviews, weighs, and determines the final output based on the individual responses.

The Consensus LLM plays a crucial role in this architecture, evaluating the responses from individual LLMs for both consistency and accuracy. It only reports the response to the prompter if a minimum threshold of consistency between the individual responses is met. Additionally, the Consensus LLM is designed to be truth-seeking by adjusting the weights of individual LLM responses over time based on their reliability.

## Ensemble Learning in the Context of LLMs

The proposed architecture can be seen as an adaptation of ensemble learning, which has been successfully applied in various machine learning tasks. Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance, and our approach seeks to apply this principle specifically to large language models.

By using an ensemble of diverse LLMs, we aim to reduce the impact of individual biases or inaccuracies, while the Consensus LLM further enhances the overall accuracy and consistency of the generated answers. This unique combination of ensemble learning and reinforcement learning allows the system to learn from experience and continually improve its performance.

## Challenges and Considerations

Implementing this architecture will come with its challenges. Some potential issues to consider include:

* **Computational complexity**: Training and deploying multiple LLMs can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive. We will need to balance the benefits of this approach with the associated costs.
* **Defining and measuring reliability**: Assigning reliability scores to individual LLMs might not be straightforward. We will need to develop clear definitions of reliable and accurate responses and create suitable evaluation metrics.
* **Ensuring diversity**: Constructing and training diverse LLMs may be challenging, as biases in the training data or model architecture could inadvertently lead to similar responses from different LLMs. We will need to explore strategies for creating and maintaining diversity among the individual LLMs.

## Conclusion

We believe that the Consensus LLM Ensemble has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models. We are excited to explore this approach further and to share our progress with the community.
